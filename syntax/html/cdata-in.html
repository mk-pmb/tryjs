<h2>CDATA in HTML</h2>

<p>It has <!CDATA[[><em>]]> no <!CDATA[[></em>]]>
special effect, that's why you see its end sequence as text
and the "em" tags did have their effect.</p>

<p>Note that what you did <em>not</em> see in above text
were the "greater than" characters at start of the would-be
character data. <!CDATA[[<em>]]>Without them<!CDATA[[</em>]]>,
the "em" tags would not be tags of their own, but be part of
a very broken "!CDATA[[&lt;em" tag that usual browsers don't
know and therefor ignore, so you see the
<!CDATA[[<em>]]>end sequence<!CDATA[[</em>]]>
without any special formatting.</p>

<p>CDATA sections also won't stop <!CDATA[[ <br class="not-a-br-tag">
  <!-- regular exclamation dash dash
  -->]]> comments from having their text-hiding effect.</p>
